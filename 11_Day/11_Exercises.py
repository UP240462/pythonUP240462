#1 Declare a function add_two_numbers. It takes two parameters and it returns a sum.
def addTwoNumbers():
    num1 = 56
    num2 = 78
    total = num1 + num2
    print(f'La suma es {total}')
addTwoNumbers()

#2 Area of a circle is calculated as follows: area = π x r x r.
#  Write a function that calculates area_of_circle.
def areaCircle():
    p = 3.1416
    r = 12
    area = p * r *r
    print(f'The area of a circle of 12 radio is {area}')
areaCircle()

#3 Write a function called add_all_nums which takes arbitrary number of arguments and sums all the arguments.
#  Check if all the list items are number types. If not do give a reasonable feedback.


#Temperature in °C can be converted to °F using this formula: °F = (°C x 9/5) + 32.
#  Write a function which converts °C to °F, convert_celsius_to-fahrenheit.


#Write a function called check-season, it takes a month parameter and returns the season: 
# Autumn, Winter, Spring or Summer.


#Write a function called calculate_slope which return the slope of a linear equation.


#Quadratic equation is calculated as follows: ax² + bx + c = 0. 
# Write a function which calculates solution set of a quadratic equation, solve_quadratic_eqn.


#Declare a function named print_list. It takes a list as a parameter and it
#  prints out each element of the list.


#Declare a function named reverse_list. It takes an array as a parameter and it
#  returns the reverse of the array (use loops).
